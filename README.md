## 🔍 What’s FIRE?

The FIRE movement (Financial Independence, Retire Early) advocates for aggressive savings, frugal living, and smart investing to retire significantly earlier than conventional timelines. Built on:

- **High savings rate** (often 50–75% of income)  
- **Frugality**: mindful spending over immediate gratification  
- **The 4% rule**: save at least 25× your annual expenses for safe withdrawal

Popular FIRE variants:
- **Lean FIRE**: minimalist lifestyle with low cost of living  
- **Fat FIRE**: moderate-to-high lifestyle during retirement  
- **Coast FIRE**: build early, then let compounding finish the rest  
- **Barista FIRE**: semi-retirement with part-time work

## ✨ Why FireFuel?

- Combines **FIRE planning with Web3** using Internet Computer (ICP) canisters for decentralized execution  
- Offers **AI-based expense categorization** and personalized financial advice  
- Enables users to **own their identity and data**, not a central server  
- Educates users about compound interest, savings rates, and early independence

## 🛠️ Core MVP Features

1. **FIRE Number Calculator**  
   Input: Monthly income, expenses, expected return → Outputs FIRE number, years to FIRE, yearly projections

2. **Expense Upload + Categorization**  
   Upload CSV → AI assigns categories → Display total spend and categorized breakdown

3. **Current Savings Reporting**  
   Enter current savings → Print/record the value for dashboard integration

🚧 All backend logic eventually moves to on-chain canisters using **Azle (TypeScript)** or **Kybra (Python)**

## 🧱 Architecture & Tech Stack

| Layer                | Technology                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Frontend             | Next.js, Typescript, Shadcn UI, Tailwind |
| Backend (Web3)       | Azle (TS canisters) or Kybra (Python)   |
| Backend (MVP)        | Flask + Python for REST endpoints        |
| AI Services          | OpenAI GPT / HuggingFace for categorization and advice |
| Storage              | SQLite (MVP), ICP stable canister maps for Web3 phase |
| Auth                 | Email login → later replaced by **Internet Identity** |

## 🌐 Web3 Roadmap

1. Convert FIRE logic into canister using **Azle**  
2. Store savings and expense data in **stable on-chain structures**  
3. Enable **Internet Identity** for decentralized login  
4. Deploy the frontend as an **assets canister** for static hosting on ICP
